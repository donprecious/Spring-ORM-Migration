# Spring ORM Migration

A streamlined, intelligent database schema migration solution for Java applications.

## 🔍 The Problem

Database schema migrations are a critical but often challenging aspect of application development. Current solutions in the Java ecosystem have several limitations:

- **Manual Code Writing**: Most tools require manually writing SQL scripts for every schema change
- **Limited Intelligence**: Existing solutions don't intelligently detect or suggest schema changes
- **Difficult Tracking**: Tracking what changes were made and why is often left to commit messages or comments
- **Painful Rollbacks**: Rolling back migrations can be error-prone and complicated
- **Testing Complexity**: Testing migrations before applying them to production is cumbersome

## 🚀 Our Solution

Spring ORM Migration aims to revolutionize database schema management in Java applications by providing:

1. **Smart Schema Comparison**: Automatically detect differences between your JPA entities and database schema
2. **Migration Script Generation**: Generate SQL scripts based on detected changes
3. **Risk Analysis**: Assess the impact and risk level of each schema change
4. **Flexible Execution**: Apply migrations immediately or schedule them for later
5. **Simplified Rollbacks**: Easily undo migrations with automatically generated down scripts
6. **CLI Interface**: Execute migrations from the command line or integrate with your CI/CD pipeline

## ✨ Key Features

- **Smart Schema Comparator**: Intelligently detects schema changes, including column renames and table restructuring
- **Customizable Risk Assessment**: Configure what changes are considered high, medium, or low risk
- **Migration History**: Track all changes with detailed metadata
- **Preview Mode**: See what SQL would be executed without applying changes
- **Interactive CLI**: User-friendly command-line interface
- **Spring Boot Integration**: Seamless integration with Spring Boot applications
- **Test-Friendly Design**: Utilities for easy migration testing

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

- **Schema Analysis**: Extract metadata from JPA entities and database
- **Schema Comparison**: Compare entity and database schemas to detect changes
- **Migration Generation**: Generate SQL scripts for schema changes
- **Migration Execution**: Apply migrations to the database
- **Migration History**: Track applied migrations

## 📋 Usage Example

```bash
# Generate a new migration
./migrate generate --description "Add user table"

# Apply pending migrations
./migrate apply

# View migration status
./migrate status

# Undo last migration
./migrate undo

# Revert to a specific version
./migrate revert --version 1.0.2
```
